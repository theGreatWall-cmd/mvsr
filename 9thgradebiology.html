This should be confusing you, so we can get started with Biology Notes:
</strong></h4>
<p>
9th grade biology may seem intimidating, but there is nothing to fear. With a bit of studying, some sleep, and proper technique, you will be a master in no time. <br>
All topics will be reviewed in further detail. The list below is just an overview. <br>
Topics covered in 9th Grade Biology include:
<ul>
	<li>Ecology</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This unit is all about the Earth, the climate, and all kinds of cycles, some of which being:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>What is life</li>
				<li>Waterways</li>
				<li>Biomagnification</li>
				<li>The carbon cycle</li>
				<ul>
					<li>You get to learn about both the fast and slow carbon cycle</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Threats to Biodiversity</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Genetics</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Biomolecule Basics</li>
		<li>Proteins and Enzymes</li>
		<li>Cell Transport</li>
		<li>Cell Cycle Regulation</li>
	</ul>
	<li>A bunch of other stuff that I don't know the unit of but still know you will be forced to learn</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Blood Types</li>
		<li>Meiosis</li>
		<li>DNA Replication</li>
		<li>Regulation of Gene Expression</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Evolution</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Population Genetics</li>
		<li>Primate Evolution</li>
		<li>Antibiotic Resistance</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The Human Body</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Nutrition</li>
		<li>Systems:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The Digestive System</li>
			<li>The Respiratory System</li>
			<li>The Cardiovascular System</li>
			<li>The Urinary System</li>
			<li>The Reproductive System</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>If you are curious about Sex Ed, it's at the bottom. There is no way of summarising this unit.<br>
	It is much simpler to learn about the whole unit. It is chronologically taught last, so it is at the bottom of the page. </li>
</ul>
<h4>First on the list is Ecology</h4>
<ul>
	<li><h5>We can start with what life is</h5></li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Important Vocabulary</strong></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Biotic</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The living components of an ecosystem</li>
				<ul><li>ex. bacteria, feathers, bones, hair</li>
					<li>Anything that is part of an organism or was part of an organism can be considered biotic</li></ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Abiotic</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The nonliving components of an ecosystem</li>
				<ul><li>ex. rocks, fire, air, sunlight</li></ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Ecosystem</li>
			<ul>
				<li>An area where different organisms interact with each other.</li>

		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><p style="font-size:6;">Now onto the real sauce: </p></strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Characteristics of Living Things</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Are made of cells. </li>
			<li>A cell is the smallest <u><b>living</b></u> thing. </li>
			<li>Unicellular or multicellular</li>
			<ul><li>Unicellular: Single Celled Organisms</li>
				<ul><li>ex. bacteria</li></ul>
				<li>Multicellular: Organisms made up of more than one cell</li>
				<ul><li>ex. humans,bats, whales, fish, etc.</li>
					<li>Literally anything that's not bacteria/single-celled is either multicelled or not considered an organism</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Have a genetic code</strong>This will be covered in higher detail further into the unit. </li>
			<ul>
				<li>DNA</li>
				<ul>
					<li>DNA is a polymer. It is composed of a crap tonne of smaller parts called monomers. It is often easier to think of this like a train.
					A single train can be composed of lots of smaller segments, each individual one being referred to as a monomer.</li>
					<li>(DNA)Deoxyribonucleic Acid</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Found in the nucleus of a cell</li>
						<li>Source code of a cell</li>
						<li>I'm not sure about y'all, but I'd guess that it's pretty important.</li>
						<li>Try not to damage it</li>

					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>(RNA)Ribonucleic Acid</li>
				<ul>
					<li>There is more than one type of RNA. These are:
					<ul>
						<li>mRNA:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Messenger RNA</li>
							<li>Copies cell's source code(DNA) for protein synthesis outside cell nucleus</li>
							<li>Main Role in Cell: Carry protein blueprints out of nucleus without taking the DNA</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>HELPFUL TIP:</strong>
