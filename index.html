 <p>This was designed on a very short timeframe with little to no consideration for looking good so please do not expect this website to look good; this website was designed with the intent of delivering information, not looking good; although that should be fixed soon as well</p>
<p>If you find any errors in my website or any of the resources provided, contact me through my school email posted down below</p>

 <h4>The point of this website was to have a place to put my experience and notes that could help incoming students, because to be honest, nothing can prepare you enough for Monta Vista</h4>
 <p>Below you will find resources I have gathered for most of the courses that are mandatory/common between students divided into different grades</p>
